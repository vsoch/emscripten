# Emscripten!

This is a tiny repository to learn (and have fun with [Emscripten]().
Specifically, I'm getting the hang of C++ and want to create some "in browser
experiments."

## Experiments

 - [hello-world](hello-world): or more properly, "Hello Dinosaur!" ([web](https://vsoch.github.io/emscripten/hello-world/))
